- Command execution on remote machines
- Easy-to-use command line interface
- Icon embedded executable for stealth

## Usage

1. Run the C2 server (`QuantumC2.exe`) to listen for incoming client connections.  
2. Run the RAT client (`QuantumRAT.py` or compiled executable) on target machines.  
3. Monitor and control connected clients through the server terminal.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (for running scripts)  
- Necessary libraries: `socket`, `ssl`, `ctypes` (ensure installed)  
- For executable files, Windows OS recommended.
